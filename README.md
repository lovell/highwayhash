# highwayhash

Node.js implementation of Google's [HighwayHash](https://github.com/google/highwayhash).

Based on [SipHash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SipHash),
it is believed to be robust against hash flooding and timing attacks
because memory accesses are sequential and the algorithm is branch-free.

This makes it suitable for random number generators and hash tables storing untrusted data.

AVX2 or SSE4.1 instruction sets will be used when available at runtime.

Expect up to 8 million operations/second,
depending on the length of the input and the output type required.

As JavaScript lacks native support for 64-bit integers,
hash values are made available as hex, string, Buffer and
low/high 32-bit unsigned integer types.

If the input to be hashed is trusted,
a cryptographically-insecure alternative is
[FarmHash](https://github.com/lovell/farmhash).

## Requirements

* x64 CPU
* Node.js v4+
* [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) and its dependencies

## Installation

```sh
npm install highwayhash
```

## Usage

```javascript
const highwayhash = require('highwayhash');
```

```javascript
const key = require('crypto').randomBytes(32);

const input = Buffer.from('The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy sleeping dog');

const hashAsString = highwayhash.asString(key, input);
// Example: '15456351453344120596'

const hashAsHexString = highwayhash.asHexString(key, input);
// Example: '143f2b6cc1fd7fd6'

const hashAsUInt32Low = highwayhash.asUInt32Low(key, input);
// Example: 1814773524

const hashAsUInt32High = highwayhash.asUInt32High(key, input);
// Example: 3598712257

const hashAsBuffer = highwayhash.asBuffer(key, input);
// Example: <Buffer 14 3f 2b 6c c1 fd 7f d6>

```

## API

* `key` is a Buffer containing 32 bytes (256-bit)
* `input` is a Buffer to calculate a hash value of

### asString(key, input)

Returns a String representing the 64-bit unsigned integer hash value of `input`.

### asHexString(key, input)

Returns a hexadecimal String representing the 64-bit unsigned integer hash value of `input`.
This is equivalent to but much faster than `asBuffer().toString('hex')`.

### asBuffer(key, input)

Returns a Buffer representing the 64-bit unsigned integer hash value of `input`.

This method is much slower then `asString` so only use this method when the hash value needs to be in a Buffer.

### asUInt32Low(key, input)

Returns a Number representing the low 32-bits of the 64-bit unsigned integer hash value of `input`.

### asUInt32High(key, input)

Returns a Number representing the high 32-bits of the 64-bit unsigned integer hash value of `input`.

## Benchmarks

* [Intel i3-4170](http://ark.intel.com/products/77490/Intel-Core-i3-4170-Processor-3M-Cache-3_70-GHz)
* Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS
* Node.js v6.9.4
* Cryptographically strong pseudo-random input via OpenSSL's RAND_bytes
